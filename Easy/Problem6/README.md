# Reverse Array (Easy)

This problem requires you to reverse an array of 32-bit floating point numbers **in-place**. The reversal must be performed directly on the input array, without using any external libraries.

## Problem Statement

Given an input array of size `N`, reverse its elements in-place so that the first element becomes the last, the second becomes the second last, and so on.

## Example

**Example 1:**

- Input: `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]`
- Output: `[4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0]`

**Example 2:**

- Input: `[1.5, 2.5, 3.5]`
- Output: `[3.5, 2.5, 1.5]`

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100,000,000
- No external libraries are allowed.
- The final result must be stored back in `input`.

## Solution

See [reverse_array.py](./reverse_array.py) for a Python implementation.
