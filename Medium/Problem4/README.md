# Sorting (Medium)

This problem requires you to sort an array of 32-bit floating-point numbers in ascending order, **using only native features (no external libraries)**.

## Problem Statement

Given:

- `data`: An array of 32-bit floating-point numbers of length `N`

Sort the array in ascending order. The sorted result must be stored back in the original `data` array.

## Example

- Input: `data = [5.0, 2.0, 8.0, 1.0, 9.0, 4.0]`, `N = 6`
- Output: `data = [1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 5.0, 8.0, 9.0]`

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000
- No external libraries are allowed.
- The sorted result must be stored back in the input data array.

## Solution

See [sorting.py](./sorting.py) for a Python implementation.
